	OLIntegration
		ContextEventDispatcher - Added header documentation.
		
		Implemented StatusResult() calls in OLIntegration and updated samples to handle 
		these when they occur.
		
		OLIntegration now uses the new SuspendSession() flow. Please refer to SuspendSession Event Sequence 
		in OnLive_SDK.chm or SuspendSession() header comments in OLApplication.h.
		
		Provided the ability for games to pump Windows message while waiting for OSP's response. The function wait_aborted()
		will be called with WaitAbortReason code when timeout occurs.

		Updated OLContainers sample to not use deprecated container keys.
		
		Samples now call Exit(OL_EXITCODE_NORMAL) when they receive a WM_CLOSE message.

		Samples now calls OnLive API function calls outside of event handlers. 
	
	OLOverlay
		MessageBoxResult() no longer returns negative button index; if the user cancels the message box 
		by pressing escape key or B button on the gamepad, a status code OL_CANCEL_BUTTON is returned.
		
		When ShowMessageBox() call fails, it no longer returns both negative button index in MessageBoxResult() and 
		OL_OVERLAY_IN_USE status code in StatusResult().
		
		Fixed Virtual Keyboard's compatibility issue. GetInputFromKeyboard() now returns OL_CANCEL_BUTTON when 
		user presses escape or button B on the gamepad after 1.068.5.5. Before 1.068.5.5, this function will return 
		an empty string without any status code.

	OLApplication
		Fixed a documentation bug for the ApplicationStatus Container's OLKEY_RO_UpTime.
		The uptime is measured in seconds, not milliseconds.
		
		The "user binding" timer is documented as 25 seconds; this is a more realistic value than 30 seconds,
		since it accounts for travel time between the SDK and the OSP.
		
		The "user unbinding" or "suspend" timer is documented as 235 seconds; Your game will have up to 235 seconds from 
		to UnbindUser or SuspendSession events to transit to OL_LOGIN_READY_TO_BIND  OR OL_LOGIN_READY_TO_STOP 
		( depending on your title's start mode )
		
		Clarified the docs for the ChangeResolution event. Ideally, a title will finish the entire user binding
		process as soon as possible (including changing into the new resolution).

	TCC
		TCC item 1.0.4 has been separated into 2 separate issues:
			1.0.4 - Title must not switch out of full screen mode while a user is bound.
			1.0.14 - Title must render at least 1 frame before setting the ready for client state.


	SDK Test Harness
		Allow Ctrl + C to forcibly turn off script reading.
		
		Status now shows the correct disk space usage in O:\PROFILE, O:\SESSION, and \TEMPORARY
		
		The User Profile now gets deleted properly when SDK Test Harness exits.
		
		SDK Test Harness now sends a Stop() event to the game when it receives a reply from Start() other than OL_SUCCESS.

	General
		Event handlers now have their specific return values. Returning invalid status code will be marked as 
		compliance failure in SDK Compliance report. For example, if your game doesn't support a resolution, 
		the ChangeResolution() event should return OL_RESOLUTION_INVALID.
		
		Rename the header files:
			olapi.h			becomes OLAPI.h
			olapplication.h becomes OLApplication.h
			olid.h			becomes OLID.h
			olservice.h		becomes OLService.h
			oltypes.h		becomes OLTypes.h
			oluser.h		becomes OLUser.h

		This release includes a major update of the OnLive SDK documentation 
		(both inside the headers and in our CHM help file). The OnLive SDK 
		CHM file now includes a more detailed "Modules" heading with organized
		sections for each OnLive API. The CHM's documentation pages (under the
		"The OnLive Software Development Kit" heading) have much more 
		information as well.
			
	Logging Policy Changes
		Titles are no longer entirely prohibited from logging messages with the
		OnLive SDK logger in final builds. However, logging rates must stay below
		1 log call per minute (on average) for log levels > OLLOG_DEBUG. You may
		log up to 1 message per second for the OLLOG_DEBUG log level.
	
		See OLService::Log for details.

	OLTypes
		We've changed the value of #define OL_MAX_USERNAME_SIZE to match the max
		string length we can store in our backend database.
	
	OLService
		We've added a #define for the SDKInfo container's name, 
		SDKINFO_CONTAINER_NAME.
		
		Container methods can now return a new OL_RETURN_VALUE_TRUNCATED status
		error if you supply a buffer that's too small to hold the entire value.
	
	OLApplication
		The unbind user timeout is 90 seconds, not 2 minutes as previously 
		documented (this was a documentation bug, the behavior has not changed).
		
		The OL_MULTI_SESSION_ATTRACT OLStartMode has been deprecated. The OSP
		will never send this start mode so you don't need to handle it.
			
		Updated return values for OLAppSessionEventHandler::Start method - you
		should now return OL_FAIL if you don't support the start mode suggested
		by the OSP (instead of OL_INVALID_PARAM). Please return OL_FAIL instead
		of OL_ALREADY_STARTED too.
		
	OLUser
		UserSessionStatus Container changes:
			Renamed OLKEY_RO_UserSessionID to OLKEY_RO_MasterSessionID.
			Renamed OLKEY_RO_UserAppSessionID to OLKEY_RO_UserSessionID.
			
		The latency and bandwidth values are deprecated and should not be 
		used.
		
		The LoadGameRequest() event is deprecated; it will never be sent.
			
		Documentation update: the Pause/Resume events can be sent by the OSP as
		a result of system events. For example while the GameInfo Overlay dialog
		is present or while a user is trying to recover from a stalled
		network connection.
	
	OLID
		Removed OLID's ++ operators because they were misleading (they generated
		a new random ID value instead of incrementing the exiting value). Use the
		base class's generate() method instead to generate a new OLID ID.

	SDK Test Harness
		Removed the multi-session attract mode, since it's now deprecated 
		(see OLApplication changes).
			
		Removed the LoadGameRequest UI command, since the underlying event has
		been deprecated.

		"load" command now takes 4th argument for game's command line
		arguments.
		
		if "bu r" ( BindUser() event with resume = true ) is issued but no save
		data found in O:\SESSION, SDK Test Harness will log as error and send
		the BindUser() event with resume = false.
	
		CTRL+C now functions properly in SDK Test Harness.
	
		Added "qaspinner" command to toggle on/off login state spinner

	Samples
		Fixed a bug that all SDK samples become not responding when user tries
		to move the window.
		
		All samples except for SDKTest now require a key press before calling
		SetLoginState(OL_LOGIN_READY_TO_START).
		
		Fixed misleading session management code. WM_CLOSE will now correctly
		call SetLoginState(OL_LOGIN_READY_TO_STOP).
	
		Changed Escape key to simulate user exits via game's exit UI.
	
		Changed Ctrl+C and Closing the window to simulate emergent exit.
		
		
1.062.4.4
	OLID		
		Added of proper OLID = OLID and removed bool override. If you use
